**INTRO**

Advanced Web Attack and Exploitations (AWAE). It is a exploit development course based on Web. it developed by Offensive Security. The course was only offline at BlackHat conference for a couple of years, then eventually Offensive Security brings it online. See the syllabus to get more details. https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/awae-syllabus.pdf

**Am I ready for AWAE ?** 

Well, this question become increasingly asked by a lot of folks. For me I wasn't hesitant to sign up; however, to be honest no body will give you the right answer except you !! whether you have a **10 yearsâ€™ experience** in the industry or **fresh graduate student like me** . Here are the things that you may consider to have it before applying for AWAE. **Otherwise that course will be heavy**. 

- You should be good with well-knowns web vulnerabilities  (LFI,SQLI ..etc)
- Experience in black box testing would be helpful as a mindset.
- Being able to read and understand complex open source project written by either the following languages ( **PHP , NodeJS , java , C#** ) 
- A solid understanding of these topics **inheritance, polymorphism** ..etc ( OOB)
- Being able to focus for long periods of time on programming & writing exploit.
- Master one interpreter language to automate thing is plus ( Python , Ruby ..etc)

**ENROLLING**

You will be provided a materials and vpn file to access the labs. The materials divided by 2 parts. A pdf file and videos. The pdf document will explain everything in details. **Exercises** will be constantly at the end of each module as well as **ExtraMile**. Keep in mind, ExtraMiles are optional, but don't skip any of them.

**EXAM !!** 

As always Offsec prepare something unbelievable. The good news is , if you understand the matrial and you did the exercises and extramiles, then don't worry the requirement to pass the exam met except to **try harder** , and never give up. **The exam** has 2 applications and each of them will ask you to bypass the authication and get RCE. so be prepared and ready !!. Here is my advices for who schedule the exam. 

- It's better to give yourself break before the exam date and enjoy with your family.

- Don't apply black box testing on input ( it won't work ). 

- Start confidently and challenge yourself to get the whole points , not only the ( **pass** requirements )

- If you spot the issue and it leads to complicated things stop!!!!! turn around!! (back later if you didn't find a unique issue)

- Debugging is the key! ( **just remember that** ) => ( print("reach line 24 :D , pass first condition :D bom!!"))

- Prepare your plan for **authentication bypass** , for instance (it could be **login issue, access controller or session prediction , weak token ..etc** ) , I recommended to use your own list     and prepare it before the exam date.

- Don't read the instructions to much :D , they won't hide the answers between the words.

  

**WRAP UP**

Advanced Web Attack and Exploitation is rewarding course and recommended to anyone who wants to delve into web bug henting. Although the course deal with white box & code review, we may have the decompiled code or a source code by hands in some cases. In addition, it will guide you on a different technique to use it in vulnerability discovery as well as debugging. At the end , it will develop a exploit to chain multi vulnerability together and craft appropriate exploit to gain remote code execution.
